## What is Purple?
Purple is a peer to peer network designed for decentralized computing. What this basically means is that each user of the Purple network has the ability to upload pieces of code, commonly known as “smart contracts” and the other computers connected to the network will execute that piece of code whenever required.  

## What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a piece of code which has it’s own internal database and runs on every machine connected to the network. Once uploaded, it cannot ever be removed and it’s code becomes public.

## What can I do with a smart contract?
Any algorithm that can be implemented on a normal computer can also be implemented in a smart contract. However, smart contracts are especially suited for tasks which require the following:
  * Public access
  * Fault-tolerance
  * Data permanence

Several areas which smart contracts are especially suited for include but are not limited to:
  * Healthcare
  * Public records
  * Machine learning
  * Decentralized applications
