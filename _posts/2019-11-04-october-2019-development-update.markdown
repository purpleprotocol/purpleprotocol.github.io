With this development update we are getting nearer to the launch of the alpha test-net. While we said last month that it was probably the last development update before the launch of the test-net it seems that there is still a bit left to go.

It is actually possible to form a test-net right now by building the [source code](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/purple) from scratch and by running a node. However, there is much functionality that is missing and bugs to be fixed.

### Participate in the bug hunt
If you wish to help speed up this process the best thing you can do is to download the source code, test it and report any bugs that you find on the [official issue tracker](https://github.com/purpleprotocol/purple/issues).

By reporting and solving bugs, your actions would be invaluable to the successful launch of the Purple Protocol as it is imperative to have a bug-free experience for everyone.

### Help us host a test-net
Another aspect of hosting a test-net is **hardware**. We will need to host at least a few dozen cloud instances as the boot nodes of the test-net which unfortunately require spending funds out of our own pockets.

We have already began small-scale testing on a few cloud instances and these incur a monthly cost.

As such, if you are a non-technical person who wishes to see the project to fruition, a very good way in which you can help is by donating funds. This will help us sustain a test-net and allow more work to be done on the core protocol.

Check out our [donations faq](https://purpleprotocol.org/blog/participate-in-purple-crowdfunding-campaign) for instruction on how to donate funds to the cause.

We thank you for any support you decide to give us! Right now, this is probably the best way in which you can help the Purple Protocol.

### Message from the founder
This is a direct and personal message from me to the community. 

I have been quiet these many months and I have been focused on one thing and one thing only: Building and polishing the Purple Protocol.

During this time, I have moved to two different countries, met dozens or possibly hundreds of incredible people, had heartbreaks and moments of ecstasy.

The only thing that has not changed is the fact that I have been focusing most to all of my time on building and launching the most performant and easiest to use decentralized ledger protocol that has ever been seen.

Today I can say that this moment is closer than ever before. I would like to thank everyone who believed and still believes in this project even though it still seems like an improbability. 

You are the reason that keeps me going.

### Summary
While this development update is still not about the anticipated launch of the test-net, it is one outlining some of the realities behind this act. It's a step closer to the great announcement which will show the world what Purple can offer.
