This blog post explains how to support Purple by participating in its crowdfunding campaing.

### How to participate
There are two ways in which you can participate in Purple's crowdfunding:
* By sending bitcoin to `1CAAxrYvQ2T4ZGkS58ULEh2icK5Fp9uwJL`. 
* By participating in our [GoFundMe campaign][gofundme].

### Motivation
Not many people know but the development of Purple up until this point has been done without any kind of funding whatsoever. This has been because of the experimental nature of the project combined with the seemingly darker market conditions.

In the beginning the idea was to develop the protocol up until it becomes testable on a network and then organise an ICO in order to get the funding necessary to further develop the protocol.

However, after several months in which regulatory pressure kept increasing, this became less and less of an option. As the project neared the inteded goal of network testability, the pressures of hosting an ICO became too great. 

Now we find ourselves in a situation where we have a great solution to the problem's of today's blockchain systems but we do not have the capital necessary to bring it to completion.

### An alternative solution -- Crowdfunding
The only solution that we have left is to ask for donations from the community. However small they may be, they might be the difference between success and failure. 

By donating you will be helping us to finish developing the fastest decentralized payment system that the world has seen. You can become part of something greater than yourself and it would mean the world to us.

### Thank you
We thank anyone who chooses to support us in achieving our mission: building the first scalable decentralized payment system. Know that by helping you will become part of something greater than yourself which has the potential to change the world.
