## What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a piece of code which has it’s own internal database and runs on every machine connected to the Purple Network. Once uploaded, it cannot ever be removed and it’s source code becomes public.

## What can I do with a smart contract?
Any algorithm that can be implemented on a normal computer can also be implemented in a smart contract. However, smart contracts are especially suited for tasks which require the following:
  * Public access
  * Fault-tolerance
  * Data permanence

Several areas which smart contracts are especially suited for include but are not limited to:
  * Healthcare
  * Public records
  * Machine learning
  * Decentralized applications

## What consensus algorithm does Purple use?
Purple uses neither Proof of Work nor Proof of Stake in order to achieve consensus. It is instead achieved by using a novel algorithm which is best described as being a **decentralized clock**. This enables the ordering of transactions in an asynchronous setting, enabling transactions to be approved in parallel.

## How well does Purple scale when compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum?
Bitcoin can only process 3 to 4 transactions per second, Ethereum on the other hand can process around 15 to 20 transactions per second which, compared to the traditional payment processor Visa who can process around 1500-2000 transactions per second is like comparing the speed of a remote controlled toy car to that of a bycicle. This is because the network can only be as fast as the slowest computer which is connected to it. <br><br> In Purple on the other hand, the transaction confirmation rate goes up with each computer connected to the network. This means that the transaction confirmation rate of Purple is in the order of the hundreds of thousands, maybe even more.

## How can I use Purple?
The main reason why smart contracts are not approachable today is the fact that they require a software developer to write and upload them to the network. This effectively prevents the vast majority of the population from harnessing the full potential of smart contracts.<br><br> We intend to launch, along with Purple, a service where software developers can upload contract templates which fulfill most of their common use cases. <br><br>For a non-technical person to use a contract template, he or she only needs to input the template's parameters and the code of the contract will be automatically generated. This is similar to how Wordpress has many website templates available written by different software developers and one can simply choose a template which fulfills his or her specific needs.<br><br> In case of custom or advanced smart contracts a software developer is still required to write the contract's source.

## Can I mine on the Purple network?
Yes. Any computer connected to the network who verifies a certain transaction or smart contract execution receives it’s fee as reward. Since the number of transactions a node in the network can execute in parallel is only limited by it’s hardware and the amount of transactions flowing through the network at that given time, nodes with better hardware will receive more transaction fees.

## Is Purple open source?
Yes. You can follow the development of the Purple protocol on our github [ organization page](https://github.com/purpleprotocol).
