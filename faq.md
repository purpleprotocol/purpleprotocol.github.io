## How can I use Purple?
The main reason why smart contracts are not approachable today is the fact that they require a software developer to write and upload them to the network. This effectively prevents the vast majority of people from harnessing the full potential of smart contracts.<br><br> We intend to launch, along with Purple, a service where software developers can upload contract templates which fulfill most of their common use cases. <br><br>For a non-technical person to use a contract template, he or she only needs to input the template's parameters and the code of the contract will be automatically generated. This is similar to how Wordpress has many website templates available written by different software developers and one can simply choose a template which fulfills his or her specific needs.<br><br> In case of custom or advanced smart contracts a software developer is still required to write the contract's source.

## Can I mine on the Purple network?
Yes. Transactions are verified by nodes that are connected to the network whom receive their fee as reward. Since the number of transactions a node in the network can execute in parallel is only limited by itâ€™s hardware, nodes with better specs will receive more transaction fees.

## Is Purple open source?
Yes. You can follow the development of the Purple protocol on our github [ organization page](https://github.com/purpleprotocol).
