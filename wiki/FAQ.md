### How fast is Purple exactly?
We do not know yet, but our guess is that it can process around a few thousand transactions per second, at least.

### Will there be an ICO/IEO/STO?
At the time of writing this, we do not have any kind of crowd-sale planned. This can potentially change in the future but we do not guarantee it. The experimental nature of the protocol combined with the regulatory uncertainty makes us restrain from doing this at the moment. 

### How will I get my hands on the token then?
Once the main-net is launched, miners will receive rewards based on their work on the chain and the token will most probably get listed on exchanges where anyone can buy it. 

### Can I run smart contracts on top of Purple?
Yes! The Purple Protocol supports Turing Complete smart contracts. We aim to provide developers with the tools necessary to develop smart contracts in commonly known programming languages such as Rust, Java, C# and other known statically typed programming languages.

### Will I be able to write smart contracts in my X favorite programming language at the launch?
Our aim is to provide support for as many programming languages as possible, however this is no easy task since each one will require a different implementation of a compiler. Before the launch we are extremely focused on developing the virtual machine responsible for executing the smart contract code and we aim to provide at launch full support for at least one programming language.

### In which programming language will I be able to write smart contracts at launch?
The first programming language that we will support will be Rust. This is because it is by far the safest and most efficient choice for developing blockchain software. After support for Rust is mature enough, we will focus on adding support for other languages as well.

### You state that Purple is a multi-asset protocol. What does this mean exactly? 
The protocol is not directly tied to its main coin (also named purple, which with a lower-cased `P` refers to the coin, not the protocol) in the same way that Bitcoin is. If you use the Bitcoin protocol you are required to exclusively send and pay fees in bitcoin. This is not the case in Purple where you can send any listed coin/asset that is listed in the ledger and possibly pay the fees in a completely different coin. You do not even need to own any purple in order to use the protocol, you only need to own an asset that is listed in it.

### Wait what? How can I pay fees in different coins?
Miners choose to include transactions in blocks based on their own preference for assets and the amount paid. It is safe to assume that they will choose transactions that are paid in the most valuable and popular coins that are listed in the ledger.

### So what is the intrinsic value of the purple coin then?
In order to use smart contracts, one has to pay for gas, which can only be done with purple.

### Ok all of this sounds nice, when can I get my hands on it?
Hopefully by the end of 2019. We aim to launch the first test-net around mid June 2019 or earlier if possible. If all goes well and there are no issues (there will surely be issues on the first test-net) for at least a few months on the test-net, then we can begin to prepare for the main-net launch.
