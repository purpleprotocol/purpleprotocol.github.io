Welcome to the wiki of the Purple Protocol! 

This is indented to be a guide and a reference for users, protocol developers, decentralized applications developers and anyone that is interested in learning or verifying the underlying properties of the protocol. 

### Introduction
Purple is an experimental advanced blockchain protocol that has been designed from day one with a strong emphasis on the following things:

* **Scalability** - In order for blockchains to fulfil their destinies, they must be able to scale. This is the most important point and goes above all else. Purple aims to provide a transaction throughput that is at least equal to the centralized payment processor VISA which can in peak times process around 50.000 transactions per second. No completely decentralized solution has ever achieved this feat, this leads us to the next point.
* **Complete decentralization** - We believe that any "blockchain system" which in any way allows a single entity or a single group of entities to modify or otherwise alter the ledger is in complete contradiction with the ideals brought forth by Satoshi Nakamoto in his original vision for Bitcoin and as such they cannot be considered to be even in the same category of things. If you apply this logic to all of the projects you will see that there are very few that truly fit this criteria (and are not forked from one that does) and unfortunately it is the most important and fundamental one. A blockchain system which **is not** decentralized **is not** a blockchain system. If Purple does not meet this criteria, then we have failed.
* **Turing Complete Scripting Capabilities** - Ethereum was the first blockchain system to bring this to fruition, and it was amazing, until the network couldn't handle the load and until the first bug in the virtual machine was found in production code. Purple strives to do better and learn from the mistakes made in the Ethereum project and do as much as possible to provide a safe and scalable architecture to deploy decentralized applications to. 
* **Ease of Use** - There is no point in building something which is hard to use, even if it is an amazing technological contraption. If a blockchain system is hard to use it will soon become a deadchain system. This also ties to the previous point: Purple attempts to provide a way for developers to write decentralized applications in already known programming languages by providing a compiler target for many known languages.
