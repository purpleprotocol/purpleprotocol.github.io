The official timeline of the Purple Protocol. This is a high-level overview of the project's progress from its inception and also contains the future Roadmap of the project.

### Timeline
* **1st of March 2018** - Official founding date and start of research and development on a scalability solution in public blockchain systems.
* **May 2018** - A first draft of the white-paper is composed which illustrates a very early SSPoW concept.   
* **September 2018** - A very early prototype written in a scripting language is tested on a private network. The core concept seems to work but it still has issues and the used language cannot provide the features necessary for further development.
* **November 2018** - The beginning of the Rust re-write of the logic tested in the prototype.
* **January 2019** - The core design of the Virtual Machine is mostly defined. 
* **May 2019** - The core consensus algorithm and chain modules are now mostly implemented in the re-write. The test-net seems to be closer but there is still more to go. 

### Roadmap
This section provides an estimation on future events regarding the Purple Protocol.
* **August 2019** - Launch of the alpha testnet. This testnet is not guaranteed to have any safety guarantees and the ledger ledger state will not be transferred into the mainnet. 
* **November 2019** - Launch of the beta testnet. This testnet is expected to behave as the main-net would. For this reason, full-scale mining will be enabled on this and coins will be transferred into the mainnet, however any issues will most probably result in rollbacks.
* **January 2020** - Launch of the mainnet. No more rollbacks.
