Most decentralized ledgers, besides allowing users to send and receive currency, also allow custom conditions for the transferral of said currency. They also allow users to embed arbitrary data into the ledger state, yielding a large array of possible applications.

Several of these are:
* The Decentralized Autonomous Organization aka The DAO. These are organizations in the conventional sense with the difference that **they run themselves**.
* Decentralized voting systems.
* Decentralized insurance systems. 
* Decentralized credentials verification i.e. school degrees, driver licenses, etc.
* Decentralized DNS.
* Decentralized identity verification systems.
* Copyright tracking.
* Any kind of permissioned system.

As you can see from the examples, these are all applications that store some kind of data that is either public or publicly verifiable. The idea is that the ledger can be used for tracking an arbitrary number of things, besides tracking currency transfer. 

That is the magic of **smart contracts**. The name was given by Nick Szabo who first theorized these kind of applications back in the 90's. Another common and arguably more descriptive name is **decentralized applications** or **dapps** for short.

A way to think of this is to **picture the blockchain as a kind of public computer, which we can all run programs on and which is owned by no one**. No one can alter its storage and no one can hack it. Because we have this magic public computer, we can use it to keep track of our possessions, and for any other purpose that we can think of.

It is very hard to imagine such a thing in today's world because we have not ever had such a thing before in our existence as a species. However, in the future these things will be common knowledge for anyone from children to seniors.
